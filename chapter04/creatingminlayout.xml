  <title>Creating a limited directory layout in LFS filesystem</title>

  <para>In this section, we begin populating the LFS filesystem with the
  pieces that will constitute the final Linux system. The first step is to
  create a limited directory hierarchy, so that the programs compiled in <xref
  linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> (as well as glibc and libstdc++ in <xref
  linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>) can be installed in their final
  location. We do this so those temporary programs will be overwritten when
  the final versions are built in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>.</para>

  <para>Create the required directory layout by issuing the following commands as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS/{etc,var} $LFS/usr/{bin,lib,sbin}

for i in bin lib sbin; do
  ln -sv usr/$i $LFS/$i
done
</userinput></screen>

  <para>Programs in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> will be compiled
  with a cross-compiler (more details can be found in section <xref
  linkend="ch-tools-toolchaintechnotes"/>). This cross-compiler will be installed
  in a special directory, to separate it from the other programs. Still acting as
  &root;, create that directory with this command:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS/tools</userinput></screen>
